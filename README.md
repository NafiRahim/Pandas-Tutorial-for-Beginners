Welcome to the Pandas for Beginners repository! This is a beginner's guide to Pandas, a popular data manipulation library in Python. The goal of this repository is to provide a step-by-step introduction to the fundamental concepts of Pandas and to help you get started with data manipulation using this powerful library.

## Usage

The repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files: 'basic.ipynb' and 'intermediate.ipynb'. 'basic.ipynb' covers useful Pandas functions and methods for beginners, while 'intermediate.ipynb' covers more advanced topics. You can use these notebooks to learn how to manipulate data using Pandas. The notebooks include several examples that illustrate these concepts, and you are encouraged to modify these examples to suit your needs.

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine, or download and unzip and open the 'basic.ipynb' or 'intermediate.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook. From there, you can follow along with the examples and start exploring the world of data manipulation with Pandas.
